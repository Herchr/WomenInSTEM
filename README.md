Starting the app:

-Make sure you have node.js installed, then type into the command-line (npm install -g expo-cli). This will download the npm package, and may take a while.
-Once the installation is finished, type into the command-line "expo start". This will open a new tab on your internet browser.
-Wait for the command-line to show a QR code. Once this pops up, go to your browser and select the "tunnel" option. Another QR code will show up.
You may have to wait until it says "Tunnel ready" to do this.
-Using your phone's camera app, scan the Tunnel QR code. You'll be prompted to open the Expo app which will then show the output of the React Native code.
This should open our app!
